COBOL stands for “Common Business-Oriented Language” and was developed in 1959 to solve the needs of people in the business world. Applications of COBOL spanned from financial applications to administrative systems widely used by companies around the world. COBOL was designed to have readable and simple syntax so that people without an in-depth knowledge of computing could effectively use the language. COBOL strayed away from math language along with data and control structures to ensure simplicity.  </p>\n        \n        <p>COBOL’s core principles of simplicity made it appeal to a much wider audience than its contemporaries. People in the business field were effectively able to manage their businesses using COBOL with little to no computer science training or education. Additionally, COBOL set the foundation for fundamental programming concepts such as structured programming and modular design. Structured programming created a more manageable environment for debugging and allowed for programs to be easily updated. The logic was very straightforward which contributed to the ease of debugging as the user can simply go down the program in a straight line to find the bug. The modular design of COBOL made dividing complex programs into smaller parts very simple. These concepts both can be massively credited with making modern debugging as good as it is. </p>\n\n        <p>Along with COBOL’s key theoretical contributions to programming languages, COBOL is still used in many business systems to this day. With that said, this is only the case for companies that established the systems in the 20th century. The fact that these systems still work sufficiently shows the reliability of COBOL even over 50 years after its creation. </p>\n\n        <p>Despite newer languages overtaking the role of COBOL in modern programming, COBOL’s contributions to structured programming and clarity are still felt to this day. </p> \n\n        <div className=\"image-container\">\n          <img src={cobolImage} alt=\"COBOL Payroll Program\" className=\"centered-image\" />\n          <p className=\"image-caption\">COBOL Payroll Program</p>\n        </div>\n\n        <p>I wrote a payroll program (as shown above) using COBOL that does a good job of demonstrating COBOL’s modular structure.

C is one of the most dynamic and innovative languages ever created. It grants users with low level access to the computer’s hardware. Although, this low-level access raises concerns about how transferable C would be from one machine’s hardware to another, it is highly portable. C would go on to cement itself as the main tool used for modern development. </p>\n      \n        <p>COBOL was a very specialized language that focused mainly on business applications. On the other hand, C had much wider use cases at the system level. C allows the user to edit components of the operating system and hardware. C’s design was all about maximizing efficiency and complete control of the machine rather than the simplicity emphasized by COBOL. C’s architecture is optimized for developers to directly interact with memory and processor components. These innovations made by C mark a shift in how programming languages would be developed down the line. C was able to combine ease of use with low level machine precision.  </p>\n\n        <p>C’s design has a good balance between low level access and high-level coding constructs that can be easily applied to large scale projects. The combination makes it possible for developers to make code that is highly efficient for operating systems, embedded systems, and much more. C is the founding father of modern languages such as: C++, Java, and Python. The main principles inherited by C are structured programming and the efficient method of handling arrays/pointers implemented by C. These languages inherited many of C’s concepts, but C itself is still widely used for applications that need to interact with the system’s hardware.  </p>  \n\n        <div className=\"image-container\">\n          <img src={cImage} alt=\"C Calculator Program\" className=\"centered-image\" />\n          <p className=\"image-caption\">C Calculator Program</p>\n        </div>  \n\n        <p>The program I wrote in C (shown above) takes numbers entered by the user and calculates the sum of the entered numbers. This program is a good example of C’s efficiency whilst handling arrays and control structures like for loops.  </p>\n      \n        <p>Lines 5-9 initialize the variables that will be used throughout the entire program and prompt the user to input numbers they want to add together. Printf prompts the user and scanf stores the user input in the previously initialized amountOfNums variable.  </p>\n\n        <p>Lines 11-21 create an array to store the numbers entered by the user. The for loop asks the user for a new input for every iteration of the loop and then stores it into the array. This process shows how C is able to efficiently handle dynamic data sets. </p>\n\n        <p>Lines 23-29 uses a second for loop to calculate the sum of the numbers in the array. The program accumulates each number in the array with a sum variable. The printf command prints the result, formatted to two decimal places. </p> \n        <div className=\"video-container centered-video\">\n        <iframe\n          width=\"560\"\n          height=\"315\"\n          src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bwaFt2zQPOA\"\n          title=\"C Programming Demonstration\"\n          frameBorder=\"0\"\n          allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n          allowFullScreen>\n        </iframe>\n      </div>\n\n        <p>First, I use the following command to compile the program: </p>\n\n        <p>gcc arraySum.c -o arraySum </p>\n\n        <p>Then, I use the following command to execute the program: </p>\n\n        <p>./arraySum </p>\n\n        <p>The program prompts the user to enter how many numbers they want to add together, which is done by the first printf statement. The scanf function then stores the input in the amountOfNums variable. The user is then asked what each of their numbers are which is done by the first for loop.

Languages of Python’s time were clunky and generally difficult to learn or use efficiently. Python aimed to be readable, simple, and flexible. The language was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Rossum wanted to improve upon C but took a different path than contemporary languages like Java. C was notorious for requiring tedious manual memory management and was very difficult to learn so Python responded by introducing a high-level and dynamic syntax that was centered around writing code that looked clean and was efficient. With all these features, Python was an extremely accessible language for programmers of all skill levels. </p>\n\n      <p>Python’s impact on software development is different from Java because it is widely used as a scripting language. This use case comes from the fact that Python is an interpreted language whereas most popular languages that came before it are compiled languages. The difference is basically that compiled languages get converted entirely into machine code before running, but interpreted languages convert line-by-line. Python’s line-by-line execution allowed for quick development and testing because it required no intermediary compiling step, allowing it to rise to the top of the scripting world. However, languages like C and Java are significantly more efficient during runtime because they are closer to the machine level (lower-level languages). </p> \n\n      <p>Python’s scripting power has made it the primary resource for most large-scale development in several fields including web development, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. Python has an extremely extensive standard library and a massive ecosystem of third-party packages. These packages have been specifically tailored to make Python easier to write across various disciplines. </p>\n\n      <p>Python also improved C’s memory leaks with an automatic memory management system and garbage collection system by simplifying resource handling. These optimizations reduced memory leaks even more significantly than Java had done. Python is extremely easy to integrate with other languages due to its versatility which is ideal for teams working across multiple languages and platforms. Python was revolutionary and completely resculpted the software development space by combining ease of use with capabilities featured in lower-level languages. Although it may not be the best language in terms of execution speed, its advantages in development time and maintainability are more than enough to justify the drop in performance. Python is the cornerstone of modern programming and has made programming less of a discipline-specific skill and more of a life skill that is useful for everybody. </p>\n\n      <div className=\"image-container\">\n          <img src={pythonImage} alt=\"Python Temperature Converter\" className=\"centered-image\" />\n          <p className=\"image-caption\">Python Temperature Converter</p>\n        </div>  \n\n      <p>This Python program is a simple temperature converter that prompts the user to provide a value for temperature and the units they are using.
